# NeuraCalc
A mental math training program inspired by techniques used by
[Arthur Benjamin](https://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_benjamin_a_performance_of_mathemagic).
The techniques are explained in depth in the book [Secrets of Mental Math](https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Mental-Math-Mathemagicians-Calculation/dp/0307338401) by Arthur Benjamin and Michael Shermer.

The program generates math problems, checks answers and measures answer speed. The types of
math problems are chosen randomly - answering might seem harder at first
but this approach (called *mixed practice*) improves recognition of different
problem types in the long term.

## Supported problem types
1) Two digit multiplication by 11
2) Two digit square of numbers ending with 5 (or multiplication numbers with first digits adding up to 10)
3) Finding number complements (distance of number from nearest "simple number", for example distance of 87 from 100 is 13)

## Planned features
1) More problem types
2) Progress evaluation and histograms
3) Feedback and explanations of problem solutions
4) Worksheet generation
